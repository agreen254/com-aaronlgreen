    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
      <h2 class="about">BLURB</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for coding drove me to pivot into the software development
        industry despite my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. My innate
        intellectual curiosity pushes me to learn something new every day. I
        strive to leave lasting user impressions and write extensible,
        maintainable code.

      <h2 class="about">Texas A&amp;M University Undergraduate Research</h2>
      <p>
        During my time studying Chemical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M, I got a
        chance to couple two modeling techniques: the kinetic Monte-Carlo (kMC)
        and Partial Differential Equation (PDE). I used these techniques to
        describe the behavior of a protein that could randomly bind to a
        neighboring receptor. The solution was composed using a 2D array
        representing a lattice of protein concentrations and receptor locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The kMC model involved generating a random number and comparing it to a
        set of numerical conditions. Each of these conditions had its own lower
        and upper bound and their sum total covered the whole range of the
        random number. Whatever condition the number falls into will execute a
        specified instruction. Some of these events include: a protein binding
        to a receptor, a protein un-binding from a receptor, a protein moving to
        a different receptor, and nothing happening at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The PDE part of the model solved the 2D time-dependent diffusion
        equation. I did this by using the Finite-Difference method, which
        produces a numerical solution for each location in the lattice by
        stepping through snapshots in time. Based on the local concentration of
        proteins, a receptor may be more "hot" or "cold", referring to the
        likelyhood of a protein to bind there.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program was implemented in C# and Matlab, and the published paper is

      <p>
        After I got my bachelor of science in chemical engineering degree from
        Texas A&amp;M, I did a five-month co-op at Oak Ridge National Lab. My
        work there was centered around a device called a Quartz Crystal
        Microbalance (QCM). A huge advantage of a QCM is its price: an average
        QCM costs $90<sup

        or more. It is a small and thin circular disk with a gold electrode in
        the middle; the model I worked with had a total circumference of 14 mm
        and 5 mm electrode circumference.

      <p>
        The QCM is a piezoelectric material, meaning that it produces physical
        force when you subject it to an electrical current. The word
        piezoelectric comes from the words πιέζειν (piezein), meaning to
        squeeze, and ἤλεκτρον (electron), meaning amber, which the Ancient
        Greeks identified as carrying electric charge. The QCM produces distinct
        peaks when subjected to its resonant frequencies because of the
        drastically reduced electrical resistance that occurs at resonance. We
        record the resonant peaks out of the box and then measure the changes in
        these peaks when we pertub the QCM somehow, e.g. adding a thin film on
        top. By comparing the expected peak to the measured peak, we can gain
        important information about the properties of the material that we
        introduced to the QCM.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used the QCM to chart the evaporation profile of water droplets: a
        pilot workflow for testing other solvents. I deposited a small amount of
        water on top of the QCM and then measured the dynamics of resonant
        frequency shifts as the water evaporated. I found that the water had to
        overcome an initial period where no evaporation occurred, and that a
        steady frequency shift following first-order kinetics occurred after
        this.

      <h2 class="about">Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        My main passion outside of coding is rock climbing. I picked it up my
        freshman year of college when a friend took me to the Texas A&amp;M
        climbing wall, and I haven't stopped since. I've climbed in Georgia,
        Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, and west/central Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main things that continues to draw me to climbing so much is
        the infinite possibilities of movement. Foot-holds and hand-holds can be
        arranged in a huge amount of variations to create a climb. Because
        climbing is such a technical sport, small differences in the relative
        locations of things can cause a huge difference in how you need to
        approach the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorite discipline within climbing is Bouldering, where the routes
        tend to be shorter and require more power. My lifetime goal in climbing
        is to do the route <em>Esperanza</em>, which is one of the most
        difficult routes located in Hueco Tanks Texas State Park. Hueco is a
        world-class climbing destination that has a gymastic and 3D style of
        climbing.
